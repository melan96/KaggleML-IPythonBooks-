#### Day01 🗓 : Titanic Disaster⛴🧊 - IPython Notebook Submission - ✅

---

Getting started with world famous Titanic disaster, machine learning model. In this session complete the python notebook with [RandomForestClassifier](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html). Reached 0.77 basemark with default configutation of model.

#### Day02 🗓 : Python Course🐍💻 - Introduction to Language - ✅

---

This course covers the key Python skills you’ll need so you can start using Python for data science.

We'll start with a brief overview of Python syntax, variable assignment, and arithmetic operators. If you have previous Python experience, you can skip straight to the hands-on exercise.

#

```python
spam_amount = 0
print(spam_amount)

# Ordering Spam, egg, Spam, Spam, bacon and Spam (4 more servings of Spam)
spam_amount = spam_amount + 4

if spam_amount > 0:
    print("But I don't want ANY spam!")

viking_song = "Spam " * spam_amount
print(viking_song)
```

#### Day03 🗓 : Python Course🐍💻 - Getting help with Python `help()` function - ✅

---

Python help() function is used to get the documentation of specified module, class, function, variables etc. This method is generally used with python interpreter console to get details about python objects.

```python
help([object])

```

```
>>> help('builtins.globals')

Help on built-in function globals in builtins:

builtins.globals = globals()
    Return the dictionary containing the current scope's global variables.

    NOTE: Updates to this dictionary *will* affect name lookups in the current global scope and vice-versa.

```
